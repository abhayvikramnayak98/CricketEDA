## Introduction

Cricket, often referred to as the 'gentleman's game,' is not just a sport but an emotion for millions of fans around the world. In the One Day International (ODI) format, the rivalry between India and the SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) has produced some of the most memorable and intense matches in cricket history. Over the years, India has seen remarkable success against these cricketing powerhouses.

This data analysis project aims to delve deep into the cricketing data to uncover trends and insights into India's winning streak against the SENA countries in ODIs. We will analyze the match statistics to identify patterns, strengths, and factors contributing to India's success.
